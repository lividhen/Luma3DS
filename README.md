# Luma3DS
*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

### What it is
**Luma3DS** is a program to patch the system software of (New) Nintendo (2)3DS handheld consoles "on the fly", adding features such as per-game language settings, debugging capabilities for developers, and removing restrictions enforced by Nintendo such as the region lock.

It also allows you to run unauthorized ("homebrew") content by removing signature checks.
To use it, you will need a console capable of running homebrew software on the Arm9 processor.

Since v8.0, Luma3DS has its own in-game menu, triggerable by <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (see the [release notes](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)).

This fork impliments the brightness tweaks from DullPointer'fork into Nanquita's 3gx-loader branch of their fork. Wow that was a mouthful ðŸ˜‚. 
This can load 3gx files, but it cannot be used with CTGP-7 as that requires a specific firm file to avoid cheating as much as possible. You can add the firm that works with CTGP-7 to the chain loader menu, and boot that when you want to play it.

### Compiling
* Prerequisites
    1. git
    2. [makerom](https://github.com/jakcron/Project_CTR) in PATH
    3. [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool)
    4. Up-to-date devkitARM+libctru
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/lividhen/Luma3DS.git`
2. Run `make`.

    The produced `boot.firm` is meant to be copied to the root of your SD card for usage with Bootstrap. It has the ability to load .3gx files, but cannot be used with ctgp7 as that needs a specific boot.firm to reduce the likelihood that somebody will implement cheats into their build. (Reasonable, but sad.)
